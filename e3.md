# Enhancement Three: Databases


The project for artifact three is a weather app in HTML and java.  It was created in January 2021. I included this artifact because it connects to a database of weather data.  I also selected this item because I was interested in how weather apps work.  I can fetch weather data using a weather API within the app.  The app was improved with metric conversions instead of Kelvin.  I would have loved to make a feature-rich app.  A feature-rich app takes more time to make and more time in testing as well.  While I was trying to connect to the weather database, I had trouble connecting and was getting a wrong number error.  The error was fixed after changing some variables and now displays the temperature correctly.
