# Enhancement Three: Databases


The project for artifact three is a weather app in HTML and java. It was created in January 2021. I included this artifact because it connects to a database of weather data. I also selected this item because I was interested in how weather apps work. I can fetch weather data using a weather API within the app. The app was improved with metric conversions instead of Kelvin. I would have loved to make a feature-rich app. A feature-rich app takes more time to make and more time in testing as well. While I was trying to connect to the weather database, I had trouble connecting and was getting a wrong number error. The error was fixed after changing some variables and now displays the temperature correctly.
