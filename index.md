## Introduction

Hello everyone, I’ve been in the SNHU Computer Science program since May of 2017.  I started school at Orange county community college taking computer information systems before transferring to Katherine Gibbs for digital media communications from 2000 to 2005.  I ended up dropping out of Katherine Gibbs when the school officially closed down. I’m now wishing to complete one of my final classes for the Computer Science program and subsequently gain my bachelor’s degree.

## Educational Reflection

I’ve discovered a lot of things while in the computer science program.  Initially, I realized that paying attention to all the details is a vital ability to have just in general, but also works well when dealing with programming projects.  Numerous times my code has neglected to assemble, all because of a simplistic blunder within this code.  Having awareness of all the different details correlates to the theory of code reviews.  During engagement of code reviews,  peers normally analyze our code and scan for errors that we may have failed to perceive.  Having a new outlook can benefit in finding disregarded indiscretions.  A further notion that I’ve determined is essential values with testing mechanisms.  Testing is crucial to many applications even outside of computer science.  assuring that a program operates correctly is key to having a functional application as it grows more complex as the project develops.  Embracing the thought processes of a tester is challenging let alone having to comprehend how to divulge anything that achieves to expose the imperfections in your designs.  Ultimately, studying the software development lifecycle was flabbergasting to me.  There is a lot of engineering and work that goes toward designing a large-size project while organizing with colleagues.  Furthermore, being able to read the demands of the customer and translating those requirements into a path for representatives is essential.

## Portfolio Summary

Each of the classes during the computer science program has accommodated me to earn the essential abilities and experience to position myself within the computer science industry.  CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle, acquainted me when dealing with the Software Development Lifecycle and how interaction with the consumer is necessary.  CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms, taught me the required information on data structures and algorithms.  CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurances taught me the basics of testing and explained how working collectively is essential for massive projects.  CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization, aided me in looking into the further complexity of computer graphics and dealing with making a good GUI.  CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts and DAD 220: Introduction to SQL accommodated me in discovering how to create and manage databases.  It explained how databases can be beneficial.


While my education was not limited to these classes, I considered that these were some of the primary classes in the program that pushed me moreover.  Of all these classes, I uncovered things I didn't know originally.  My first enhancement builds directly from a website template and is aimed at creating my own private webpage/portfolio.  I chose to do this to express my skills working with HTML, servers, IT 145, and CS 410. My second enhancement builds off of a calculator project I have been working on.  I wanted to work with that project in order to combine new calculations and add what I learned from CS 250 and CS 260, by combining data structures and algorithms within the application. 

Finally, my third enhancement draws from both DAT-220 and CS-340.  I decided to construct an HTML/Java interface that used an API to communicate with a database.  Across the board, these artifacts depict three separate projects and don’t necessarily coincide well collectively.  Nonetheless, I believe that collectively, they provide me to illustrate what I’ve learned during the program.  I understand that the improvements made to these three projects exemplify my knowledge and demonstrate my capability in computer science.

## Preparing for the future

My situation right now does not heavily rely on programming skills.  Nevertheless, possessing certain skills could unlock added possibilities in the future.  By expressing my talents, I could relocate to another state and gain further programming exposure.  Presently, my occupation plans are on hold.  I have less than three classes left till I graduate but don’t have anything arranged after I graduate.  The common outcome is that hopefully, I can retire through passive income projects existing in the digital realm.  I’d like to have 100% job security of not having to work while generating passive income with digital assets instead of just 10 - 25%.  I plan to concentrate on that since I'm limited on what I can do in 24 hours.
