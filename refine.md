### Refinement Plan & Code Review
## Category One: Software Engineering/Design

The artifact that I chose for the Software Engineering/Design enhancement is implementing some of the planned improvements for my ePortfolio since I never created a portfolio.  For this portion of the project, I would like to utilize what I learned working with HTML and CSS. For my final project, I would like to apply a webpage located at http://cs499.tk on my server using WAMP.  while we are using one of the premade themes that is available through GitHub pages, I would like to produce my design theme employing my skills in HTML and CSS to my own private page.  To accomplish this, I intend to take the experiences that I learned and do more research on applying HTML and CSS to GitHub pages. This portion should illustrate my skills in software design and engineering by developing my GitHub portfolio collection with a private page. It will further express my skills in HTML and CSS and my capacity to implement them in a stage that is foreign to me.

## Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

I’ve discovered a lot of things while in the computer science program. Initially, I realized that paying attention to all the details is a vital ability to have just in general, but also works well when dealing with programming projects.  Numerous times my code has neglected to assemble, all because of a simplistic blunder within this code.  Having awareness of all the different details correlates to the theory of code reviews. During engagement of code reviews,  peers normally analyze our code and scan for errors that we may have failed to perceive.  Having a new outlook can benefit in finding disregarded indiscretions. A further notion that I’ve determined is essential values with testing mechanisms.  Testing is crucial to many applications even outside of computer science. assuring that a program operates correctly is key to having a functional application as it grows more complex as the project develops.  Embracing the thought processes of a tester is challenging let alone having to comprehend how to divulge anything that achieves to expose the imperfections in your designs. Ultimately, studying the software development lifecycle was flabbergasting to me.  There is a lot of engineering and work that goes toward designing a large-size project while organizing with colleagues. Furthermore, being able to read the demands of the customer and translating those requirements into a path for representatives is essential.

## Category Three: Databases










## Code Review




> Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.









### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1 hi how are you
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ShahzadSatarAlikhan/ShahzadSatarAlikhan/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
