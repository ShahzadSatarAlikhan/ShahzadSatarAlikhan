## Refinement Plan & Code Review
### Category One: Software Engineering/Design

The artifact that I chose for the Software Engineering/Design enhancement is implementing some of the planned improvements for my ePortfolio since I never created a portfolio.  For this portion of the project, I would like to utilize what I learned working with HTML and CSS. For my final project, I would like to apply a webpage located at http://cs499.tk on my server using WAMP.  while we are using one of the premade themes that is available through GitHub pages, I would like to produce my design theme employing my skills in HTML and CSS to my own private page.  To accomplish this, I intend to take the experiences that I learned and do more research on applying HTML and CSS to GitHub pages. This portion should illustrate my skills in software design and engineering by developing my GitHub portfolio collection with a private page. It will further express my skills in HTML and CSS and my capacity to implement them in a stage that is foreign to me.

### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact that I chose for the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement is implementing more functions to a calculator app. The planned improvements for this project are implementing scientific calculations and GUI. For this portion of the project, I would like to utilize what I learned dealing with application development and algorithms. For my final project, I would like to apply what I learned to my C++ calculator app. To accomplish this, I intend to take the experiences that I learned and do more research on applying scientific algorithms and GUI. This portion should illustrate my skills in Algorithms and Data Structures. 

### Category Three: Databases

The artifact that I chose for Databases is implementing functions to a weather app that connects to a database with updated weather data. The planned improvements for this project are implementing weather data to calculate weather conditions through a weather API.  For this portion of the project, I would like to utilize what I learned dealing with advanced programming concepts.  I decided to use html and java for my programing language that i will use to accomplish this project as of now. To achieve this, I intend to take the experiences that I learned and do more research on incorporating weather data. This portion should illustrate my skills in Databases.

### Final Thoughts

For my CS499 final project, I did work outside my courses.  I wanted to adopt three artifacts that symbolized something to me.  I wanted to choose projects that I considered and that I would proceed to use in my experience.  I chose to focus on making my private ePortfolio better for project one.  I plan to Update a calculator app with more functions for project two.  Finally, i plan to update a weather app with temperature data for project 3.
