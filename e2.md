# Enhancement Two: Data Structures & Algorithms


Artifact one for software design/engineering consists of a custom web portfolio written in HTML and CSS. I thought this would be good to include since I didnâ€™t have a personal profile and have always been wanting to make one.  I chose to incorporation the finished product on my server using WAMP which probably won't have SSL certification. I used a John Doe template to aid me in getting started and I am not sure when the original template was made.  I chose this role because I wanted to learn more about web development and incorporate it into my projects that I can showcase on my terms. Programming is found throughout all fields of technology, not just web and software development.  I believe I accomplished what I wanted to do.
