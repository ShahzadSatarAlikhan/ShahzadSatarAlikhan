# Enhancement Two: Data Structures & Algorithms


Artifact two for Algorithms and data structures consist of a scientific calculator made in c#.  The enhancements were making a GUI with buttons and Scientific calculations like cos and sin.  This artifact was created towards the end of January 2021.  I chose this artifact because, by definition, an Algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.  A basic algorithm for division, cos, sin, etc. were components of the artifact showcasing algorithms and data structure.  The artifact was giving a graphical user interface and some scientific calculations were implemented.  I learned when you input numbers into a calculator, the combined circuit transforms those numbers into binary strings of 0s and 1s.  The unified circuits then use those strings of 0s and 1s to turn transistors on and off with power to achieve the wanted computations.  I believe I met some of my goals.  I had problems with making the program open in full screen.  I had to resize the screen to exit the program.  I also had problems with the GUI not displaying correctly.  I need to also finish working on the exit button.  Right now it is currently button 4.
